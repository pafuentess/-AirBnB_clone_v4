# Web Dinamic

Dynamic website is a collection of dynamic web pages whose content changes dynamically. It accesses content from a database or Content Management System (CMS). Therefore, when you alter or update the content of the database, the content of the website is also altered or updated.

Dynamic website uses client-side scripting or server-side scripting, or both to generate dynamic content.

Client side scripting generates content at the client computer on the basis of user input. The web browser downloads the web page from the server and processes the code within the page to render information to the user.

In server side scripting, the software runs on the server and processing is completed in the server then plain pages are sent to the user.
